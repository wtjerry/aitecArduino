Content-Lenght: 14 is probably not enough, but idk how to exactly find out the required bytes. Maybee using a String instead of char[] and then using thatString.length().


sensorIsOccupied is a constant which is currently 1. Idk what the range of that sensor is.


SENSOR1_PIN and SENSOR2_PIN are currently set to arbitary values need to be set correctly.


IP addresses / ports may be wrong, same for host php address.


displayParkingLotState does not yet do anything.
