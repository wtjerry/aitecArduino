every minute from arduino to host:
sensor1 = int, 
sensor2 = int, 
occupied = boolean
getParkingLotState --> callback(parkingLotState)



arduino itself:
calculate occupied state (from sensor1 and sensor2)
update parkingLotState
display parkingLotState state



parkingLotState is a Flag:
  - reserved
  - occupied

Possible states: 
        - reserved & occupied 
        - reserved
        - occupied
        - NONE

One possibility for indicating the parkingLotState is:
- reserved & occupied --> RED
- reserved            --> YELLOW
- occupied            --> RED
- NONE                --> GREEN
